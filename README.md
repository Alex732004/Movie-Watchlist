## Movie Watchlist Project

## About this Project
The Movie Watchlist is a group project of 5 members implemented using Java. Its structure closely follows Clean Architecture using many different design principles such as SOLID, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion, and Open-closed. The project has the following use cases: sign-up, login, get/add/remove from the watchlist, get/update/remove ratings, search for movies, and get movie info using an API. In addition to the coding aspect, this project showcases the use of Git by creating a repository, making branches, and merging them back into the main branch after review.  Members are required to track changes in files, collaborate with other team members, manage code, provide meaningful and detailed pull requests, and review other members' pull requests.

## Problem Domain
The problem domain we are planning to focus on is a movie watchlist platform which allows users to consolidate movies they intend to watch, while also enabling them to record and reference their personal ratings post-viewing.

## Description of Application
The Movie Watchlist App leverages the OMDb API to present users with an extensive list of movies. Once registered and logged in, users can navigate through this comprehensive movie list, which boasts features like sorting by ratings and box office revenue. Within their account space, users can curate their own "Movies to Watch" list, adding or removing titles based on their preferences. Furthermore, users have the ability to assign personalized ratings to movies. As an additional convenience feature, if development time permits, the app will also track and display a "Recently Visited" list, allowing users to quickly revisit movies they've shown interest in.
